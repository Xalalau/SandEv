# SandEv - Sandbox Events System

This repository contains gm_construct 13 beta base, on which the map content itself is mounted.

It's being tested as a standalone addon capable of hotloading itself.
(it means SandEv can be included by other addons without the players subscribing to it)

Modders will be able to use this base on any map if they want to.

Almost no documentation exists at this moment. :)

You're free to test the system if you want to (coding is required).

Some of the base features:
  - Multi-tier events;
  - Event memories with support for dependencies and incompatibilities;
  - Support multiple bases with their own events and memories;
  - Events rendering;
  - Lots of mapping focused entities;
  - Self hotloader;
  - Custom lobby system, instantiated once per base.
  - Lots of random libraries;
